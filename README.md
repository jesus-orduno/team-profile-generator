# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## Installation

- `npm install` to install required dependencies like Jest, Inquirer, and Node.js

## Usage

- Run `npm run test` to check that all tests pass.
- Run `node index.js` to start the application.
- Answer the questions to generate your team profile. Name, ID, and Email will be required for each employee. The role will determine what additional information is required.
- Once all employees have been added, the application will generate an HTML file in the `dist` folder.
- Open the HTML file in your browser to view the team profile. The generated page will include functional email links and GitHub profiles where applicable.
